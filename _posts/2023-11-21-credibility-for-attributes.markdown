Dear  Mr. Graham Weaver,

> TL/DR: [Your emphasis on hiring attributes instead of experiences](https://youtu.be/Zy7Nld2_JSw?si=EygOp4BKjdIrzRob&t=2392) is refreshing, but what about credibility? Lack of credibility gets me into trouble, and I would love to create credibility for my attributes. Can you help me? 

In 2018, after two startup failures, I found myself questioning my path in entrepreneurship. I wondered if there was something irreparably broken with me, and I looked for people from different walks of life to assess how alien my struggles were.

I can’t imagine anyone who had a life that is more distinct from mine than Kelly Slater. By the late 1990s, while I was struggling with my first startup and with finding a girlfriend, Kelly already had six Surf World Championships and he dated Pamela Anderson.

My theory predicted that Kelly would have an excellent midlife transition after experiencing success and after having a lot of fun growing up. I was wrong, and Kelly reported that his midlife transition was tough. I felt human hearing his account that also described my own struggles.

Learning that success had a toll on his wellbeing was also valuable. I was convinced that my failures were the source of my suffering, and that success would have magically made up perfectly blue skies. My problem was wrong expectations, not lack of success.

So I did not give up entrepreneurship, and [your emphasis on hiring attributes instead of experiences](https://youtu.be/Zy7Nld2_JSw?si=EygOp4BKjdIrzRob&t=2392) is refreshing, but what about credibility?  Let me give you one example when lack of credibility got me into trouble.

I was hired as a product manager, and I spent the first 6 months working as an engineer. I learned a new domain, and documented barriers to innovation before moving to the product team. As a product manager I interviewed people from various departments to validate my findings, and they were sound.

After two weeks, I presented a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and a set of actionable coherent actions to the owners. I got pats on my back. The CTO told that he could not agree more with me, and the CEO gave me a “Fuck! He is right!”. Given my somber diagnosis, this felt way too easy. I pushed it forward asking to discuss it with the board, the next day if possible.

Long story short, I never heard back from anyone, and I was eventually fired. Months later, while doing my debriefing to learn how I could improve, I asked Marty Cagan for insights, and it was obvious for him.

> “If you couldn’t predict how any exec team would respond to someone with no credibility coming in after two weeks and presenting a deck line that, then I don’t know what to tell you.”

I am very grateful for Marty's feedback, but that hurt. Not a word questioning the sanity of my diagnosis, or the quality of my policies and actions. Yet, I naively missed something crucially important: credibility.

Dear Mr. Graham Weaver, how can I craft credibility for my attributes to save me from similar trouble in the future?
